Hello mjdibella,

 I want to first congratulate you on that module.
 it's really impressive and very helpful. thank you for the commit.
 
 I do have some questions on the first function of the module.
 
 I kinda understand what it do, but if you could explain the process. 
 
like why create a registryurl ?

thank you and sorry I did not found anoher way to discuss. I am new to git hub.
